# Quadcopter-Autonomous-Landing

This project designs an autonomous landing system for a UAV on a slow-moving target, handling target search, heading angle estimation, target state estimation, and velocity control without human intervention or communication with the landing marker. A simulation was developed using _CoppeliaSim_ and _Python_. The UAV and landing marker operate independently. This approach ensures the UAV can land accurately even on a moving target.
